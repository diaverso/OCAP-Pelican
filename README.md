## What is it?

OCAP is a **game-changing** Arma 3 addon that allows serverside recording of missions in addition to easy playback on an interactive (web-based) map.

- Quantify personal and group performance in difficult missions
- Observe the role your teammates played in the overall battle
- Learn what tactics and strategies work and don't work against AI or players

## **INSTALLATION**

install docker linux: (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)<br>
Clone repository
-     git clone https://github.com/diaverso/OCAP-Pelican
Enter the folder
-     cd OCAP-Pelican
Add permissions to setup.sh
-     sudo chmod +x setup.sh
Execute the script
-     ./setup.sh
It will generate a secret automatically, it will show it in the console, so you can add it to the configuration of the weapon 3 mod.

## **Configure Arma 3 MOD**
Download the Arma 3 mod<br>
(https://github.com/OCAP2/OCAP/releases/download/v2.0/web.7z)<br>

You have to add in the configuration file called OcapReplaySaver2.cfg.json the secret (It is automatically generated by setup.sh).<br>
In newUrl you have to change the ip, for the one that appears in the docker.<br>
Use this command to see the ip of the container.<br>
-     docker inspect -f '{{.Name}}: {{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' ocap-web
